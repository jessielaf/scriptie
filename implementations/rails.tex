This test uses Ruby 2.5.5 and rails version 5.2.3.

Install rails and the mysql client by running
\begin{verbatim}
  gem install rails mysql2
\end{verbatim}

Create a new rails project with mysql and focussed on building an api
\begin{verbatim}
  rails new modular_monolith -d mysql --api
\end{verbatim}

Change your database name and password in the \texttt{config/database.yml}
\begin{verbatim}
  default: &default
    ...
    password: root

  development:
    ...
    database: rails
    ...
\end{verbatim}

The time has come to create the first model. This can be done by:
\begin{verbatim}
  rails g model Employee name:string birth_date:date
\end{verbatim}

Rails has created the model in \texttt{app/models/employee.rb} but the model does not contain the given attributes. Thus change the model to
\begin{verbatim}
  class Employee < ApplicationRecord
    validates :name, presence: true
    validates :birth_date, presence: true
  end
\end{verbatim}

When trying to change the location of the model rails didn't work. You can specify one different folder, but not multiple like we need in a modular monolith. Therefor rails is not a viable option.
