Spring has something called initliazr which can be found at \hyperref{https://start.spring.io/}. On this site select Kotlin as the language, leave group empty, fill artifact with modular\_monilith and last of all add JPA and MySQL as a dependency.

First the interface for the API:
\begin{verbatim}
  package modular_monolith

  import kotlin.reflect.KClass

  interface Api {
      fun getSerializer(): KClass<*>;
      fun getRepository(): KClass<*>;
  }
\end{verbatim}

As you can see
