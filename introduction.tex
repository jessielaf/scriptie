\section{Motive}
EFFE as a company uses the SaaS model in order to comply to itâ€™s expected growth. The basic SaaS model includes the basic application or MVP. This is in order to keep the application as abstract as possible. So that every company can connect their scheduling procedure to EFFE. But EFFE also wants to cater to the needs of bigger clients. This is why EFFE has created building blocks.

Building blocks are features that can be added/removed from the application. This can be done by the user or by EFFE. Examples of building blocks are white labeling, integration with frontend system and payroll integration. These building blocks are not required when acquiring EFFE but can be added one by one.

\section{Intention}
\label{sec:Intention}

So the question is how is EFFE going to implement these building blocks. There are a few requirements:
\begin{itemize}
	\item They need to be interchangeable. Meaning the same building block can be changed with another one that does the same job with maybe extra functionality.

	\item They should be able to do everything programming related. From if else to database calls.

	\item They have impact on the frontend as well as the backend

	\item Building block should be completely separate from the application (loosely coupled)
\end{itemize}
