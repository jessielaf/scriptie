\chapter{Preface}
I am Jessie Liauw A Fong, 20 years old. I was born in Amsterdam but moved to Zaandam and still live there. I started programming in 2010 when I was in the first class of middle school. After a year of programming my interest stagnated but in 2015 I chose to begin the study software engineering and I immediately felt that passion again and I havenâ€™t lost that pasion since. In the end of 2015 I started my first software engineering job at The EsportsWall. This was a voluntary job because I did not have enough skills to get paid. 3 months later I did to start my internship at Endouble. I worked at Endouble for 1 year. 5 months as an intern and 7 months as an part time employee.

After I finished my internship at Endouble I started by own company JCB Development. Where I build high-end websites.

At the end of my time at Endouble I started a new parttime internship at Ximedes where I learned a lot about infrastructure. This is also the company I met my now co-worker Erik Schouten. He worked at CargoLedger and that is also where I work now. In the beginning of September 2018 I started a new company together with Stijn Claessen and Siebe Goos called EFFE Planning. This is also the company I will do my thesis in.

This thus means I know the ins and outs of the company.
