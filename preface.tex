\chapter*{Preface}

I am Jessie Liauw A Fong. Born on April 1th 1998 in Amsterdam. When I was three years old I moved to Zaandam, in which I still live. My programming journey started in 2010 in the first grade of middle school. I was programming on the Texas Instruments TI-84 Plus calculator we got for math. Even though I loved programming this early on, my first actual experience began in 2015 when I started the study software engineering at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. In late 2015 I started a voluntary job as software engineer at the EsportsWall. I decided to take this job so I could improve my skills. This job helped me get an internship and eventually a job at Endouble, where I worked for a year as a software engineer.

At the end of my time at Endouble I started a new parttime internship at Ximedes where I learned about software architecture and infrastructure. This is also the company I met my now co-worker Erik Schouten. He worked at CargoLedger where I currently work as a software \& devops engineer. At the start of September 2018 I started a new company together with Stijn Claessen and Siebe Goos called EFFE Planning. EFFE makes an automated employee schedule application where clarity, ease of use and efficiency are central. This application will be the subject of this research.
